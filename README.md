# Welcome to DeepGamer

This is an implementation of a Q-learning algorithm. It is intended to learn to play to <a href=https://gym.openai.com/envs/>OpenAI gym</a> games. 
It is based on the version of the algorithm described by <a href=http://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/>Tambet Matiisen</a>. It is currently working on CartPole-v1. 

## Requirements

You will need TensorFlow, tflearn and gym to run the code. To install them go in the DeepGamer directory and type in a terminal:
